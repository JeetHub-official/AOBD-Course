# AOBD-Course
The repository contains various Big Data algorithms which we implemented as a part of our 'Algorithms and Optimization for Big Data' Course at School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad University.

List:
#### 1. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent with batch data
#### 2. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent with stream data
#### 3. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Normal Equation Method with batch data
#### 4. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Normal Equation Method with stream data
#### 5. Collaborative Filtering- Stochastic Gradient Descent for Matrix Factorization
Collaborative filtering is a recommendation approach where rating of user u for item i is computed using ratings of item i given by other like minded users of u. This is an implementation of SGD for Matrix Factoriation used in Collaborative FIltering approach. This file creates a sparse random Ratings matrix whose rows are denoted by number of users and columns denote the number of items. 

#### 6. Collaborative Filtering- Streaming Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent for Matrix Factorization
This is an implementation of the paper [Parallel Collaborative Filtering for Streaming Data](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.230.8613&rep=rep1&type=pdf). It is a collaborative filtering approach (recommendation approach) which is done by distributing the streaming big data among different workers. This file creates a sparse random Ratings matrix whose rows are denoted by number of users and columns denote the number of items. Further, it applies collaborative filtering approach using the algorithm given in the paper by streaming the random matrix data. 


#### 7. Stream Algorithm
#### 8. k-means and k-mediods with batch data
#### 9. CluStream Algorithm
This algorithm is an implementation of the paper [A Framework for Clustering Evolving Data Streams](http://www.vldb.org/conf/2003/papers/S04P02.pdf). This paper discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering which is guided by application-centered requirements.
